    "bio": "I’m the kind of person who can’t see a piece of old tech without wondering how to bring it back to life. My journey started with 'modding' a school tablet and fixing family phones, and it led me to building full-scale home servers from what others called 'junk' hardware.\n\nCurrently a 3rd-year Computer Science student at HTI, I refuse to be boxed into a single 'track.' I dive into Backend, explore Cyber Security, and mess around with Video Editing. To me, it’s not about the title; it’s about solving problems and understanding how technology works under the hood. If a system needs a workaround or an idea needs to be executed smartly and on a budget—I’m the one for the job.",

Now, this 'e-waste' handles my entire network's ad-blocking, stores my files as a NAS, and runs my web projects—all powered by a single USB charger. It’s proof that with the right optimization, hardware limitations are just a mindset.",
